# POKEMON RUSTED RED

A command-line reinterpretation of Pokémon Red, created as a learning project to develop Rust proficiency.

## Project Goals

* Prioritize exploring Rust concepts, memory safety, and data structures rather than full gameplay accuracy.
* Keep external dependencies to a minimum. Common crates such as `serde` may be used when they align with real-world Rust practice.
* Write idiomatic Rust rather than replicating patterns from other languages.

## Building from Source

This project is not intended for general use yet, but it can be built locally.
Clone the repository and run:

```
cargo build
```

(Release builds may not be fully supported.) The compiled executable will be available in the `target` directory.
